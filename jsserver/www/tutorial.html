This page provides a very brief tutorial about the visualization system.

What we see below is a network. Networks are made of two types of elements: nodes and edges. Nodes are the circle elements in the visualization. Nodes commonly denote anything that can be a “noun". Edges are the line elements in the visualization, and they connect nodes. Edges commonly denote anything that can be a “verb”.

The visualization below is interactive (as are the rest in the study). Please click on a node to continue.

Awesome!
Please click on an edge to continue.

Wonderful! You’re a natural! Let’s get started!
