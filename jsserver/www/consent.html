    <h1>Hello! Thank you for participating in this data visualization study!</h1>
    <h3>It should take less than 5 minutes to complete. Here is what you need to know:</h3>

<!--<div id="purpose" class="well well-lg">-->
<!--<b>Purpose:</b>-->
<!--I am trying to understand which visual representations are most prominent in network visualizations. In this experiment, I will present a network and I would like you to click on the most visually noticeable part. Once you click, another visualization will automatically be loaded. Your responses are not timed, but please do not take more than 5 seconds to make a decision—I would like to see how visual representations affects attention.-->
<!--</div>-->
<div id="purpose" class="well well-lg">
    <b>Purpose:</b>
    The goal of this experiment is to understand which visual representations are most prominent in network visualizations. When you are presented with a network, I would like you to click on the most visually noticeable segment. Once you click, another visualization will automatically be loaded. The collected data will be used to to see how visual representations affects attention. Aside from this informational page and the web experiment, there is a brief tutorial, and a short demographic survey.
</div>
<!--<div id="data" class="well well-lg">-->
<!--<b>Collected Data:</b>-->
<!--Since this is an online experiment, I will be recording the following information:-->

<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Click coordinates</li>-->
    <!--<li>Attributes of the presented visualization</li>-->
    <!--<li>Some demographic information (at the end)</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--I am also using Google Analytics to measure web traffic, although user tracking has been turned off to keep these sessions anonymous. In the spirit of open and reproducible science, I plan to publicly share the collected data (which again, is anonymous). If you understand, please click on the “I consent” button below.-->
<!--</div>-->
<div id="data" class="well well-lg">
    <b>Collected Data:</b>
    Since this is an online experiment, the following information will be collected:

    <ul>
        <li>Click coordinates</li>
        <li>Attributes of the presented visualization (e.g. size, shape, color, etc)</li>
        <li>Anonymous demographic information (at the end)</li>
    </ul>

    Google Analytics is being used to measure web traffic, although user tracking has been turned off to keep these sessions anonymous. In the spirit of open and reproducible science, the collected data will eventually be openly shared with the public.
