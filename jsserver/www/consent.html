    <h1>Hello! Thank you for considering participating in this data visualization study!</h1>
    <h3>It should take less than 5 minutes to complete! Here is what you need to know:</h3>
</div>
<div id="purpose" class="well well-lg">
<b>Purpose:</b>
I am trying to understand which visual representations are most prominent in network visualizations. In this experiment, I will present a network and I would like you to click on the most visually noticeable part. Once you click, another visualization will automatically be loaded. Your responses are not timed, but please do not take more than 5 seconds to make a decision—I would like to see how visual representations affects attention.
</div>
<div id="data" class="well well-lg">
<b>Collected Data:</b>
Since this is an online experiment, I will be recording the following information:

<ul>
    <li>Click coordinates</li>
    <li>Attributes of the presented visualization</li>
    <li>Some demographic information (at the end)</li>
</ul>

I am also using Google Analytics to measure web traffic, although user tracking has been turned off to keep these sessions anonymous. In the spirit of open and reproducible science, I plan to publicly share the collected data (which again, is anonymous). If you understand, please click on the “I consent” button below.
</div>
<div id="requirements" class="well well-lg">
<b>Requirements:</b>
    This experiment absolutely needs to be taken from a desktop or laptop computer. Unfortunately mobile and tablet devices are not supported at this time. If you are on an unsupported device, you may provide your email so that I may send you one reminder to participate. I will not share your email with anyone outside of the experiment team (as required by law). This experiment makes heavy use of javascript, so javascript must be enabled. This experiment also makes use of the browser cache to keep track of your session.
</div>
<div id="consent" class="well well-lg">
Again, thank you so much for helping with my experiment! If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at <u>ngopal [at ] uw [dot] edu</u> with the word “<u>study42</u>” in the title.
