Hello! Thank you for considering participating in this data visualization study! It should take less than 5 minutes to complete!

As required by law, to participate in my experiment I must briefly explain its purpose and what data I’m collecting.

Purpose:
I am trying to understand which visual representations are most prominent in network visualizations. In this experiment, I will present a network and I would like you to click on the most visually noticeable item. Once you click, another visualization will automatically be loaded. Your responses are not timed, but please do not take more than 5 seconds to make a decision—the point of this experiment is to see how visual representations affects attention.

What Data I Will Be Collecting:
Since this is an online experiment, I will be recording the following information:

- Click coordinates
- Attributes of the presented networks

I am also using Google Analytics, although user tracking has been turned off to keep these sessions anonymous. In the spirit of open and reproducible science, I plan to publicly share the collected data (which again, is anonymous). If you understand, please click on the “I consent” button below.

Again, thank you so much for helping with my experiment! If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at ngopal [at ] uw [dot] edu with the word “study42” in the title.
